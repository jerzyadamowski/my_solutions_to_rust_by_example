### How to run code:

You can use "Code Runner" plugin to run any code in this project from where were you pointing out.

`install ext formulahendry.code-runner`

Add these settings to `settings.json`
```
"code-runner.executorMap": {
    "rust": "cd $dir && rustc -g $fileName --out-dir $workspaceRoot/bin/$fileNameWithoutExt && $workspaceRoot/bin/$fileNameWithoutExt/$fileNameWithoutExt"
  }
}
```

This hack leaves projects space little bit cleaner. And source code can be debugable.
