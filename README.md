# What is this?

This is my solutions to excercises available at `https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/`
I got rid of warning - only pure single binary to easy to follow with debug line by line.
Previous version had single file executed separately now its single application.

### How to run code:

cargo run

## NO WARRANTY GIVEN ;)
